                <p className="text-[17px] mt-8 text-gray-700">Go beyond reach and engagement. When you build landing pages, you invite your customers to learn more about your brand and call them to action. Increase product sales from your online store, gain traffic from your blog posts, and encourage readers to sign up for your newsletter or download files with landing pages meant for any of your consumer’s intent.</p>
                <p className="text-[17px] mt-8 text-gray-700 ">Either create a landing page from scratch or customize one of our landing page templates. We have ready-made layouts that fit any industry: modern and sleek for tech startups, chic for fashion brands, or young and trendy for your class. For a higher chance of conversion, don’t forget to include the following on your template: a photo of what you’re offering, a hyperlink to your download or a space where they can enter information, and a persuasive call-to-action.</p>
